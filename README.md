## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. **Instagram**
   - Allow users to share quick, real-time updates by posting stories
   - Multiple ways to interact (likes, comments, DMs)

2. **Spotify**
   - Personalized playlists
   - Modern UI that makes navigation and discovery feel smoothly

3. **Notion**
   - Flexible drag-and-drop content organization
   - Rich templates and support for code blocks

### App Idea 

I’d like to create an app called **StudyMatch**, designed to help students find accountability partners for focused study sessions. 

Features:
- Users can set their study availability and goals, like "Study algorithms from 8–10 PM", and get matched with others who have similar time slots or subjects. 
- Once matched, users can join a virtual study room, with optional features like timers, focus mode, and brief check-in messages.  

## Notes

- I encountered issues with mismatched IBAction connections in storyboard, which caused runtime crashes (`signal 9`).
